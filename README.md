## Description

In this game, the player must find all pairs of matching cards.

The player starts off by selecting a grid size - they can choose between 20, 30, or 40 cards. The cards are shuffled and initialized to be displayed face down. The player needs to tap cards to flip them over and match them with their corresponding pair. 

If the player would like to shuffle the cards while playing the game, they can tap the `Shuffle` button. They can also tap the `Restart` button to restart the game.

The player's score is calculated as the difference between the number of total attempts and the number of successful matches.
Similar to golf, the lower the score, the better. Theoretically, the best score the player can obtain would be -10 (with a grid size of 20).

Once the user taps the "Play" button, this screen is presented to them. All the cards are flipped over and their score is set to zero. The user can begin playing by tapping cards.

### Matches Made

This is what the screen looks like when matches are made. The matched cards stay face up and the others stay face down. The score updates as they keep looking for matches.

### Larger Grid Size
